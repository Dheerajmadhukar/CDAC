Problem Details: Email Spoofing Detection: Identify and flag emails with misleading sender information (spoofing)
Description:

Email spoofing is a form of cyber attack in which a hacker sends an email that has been manipulated to seem as if it originated from a trusted source.
This kind of identity deception is widely used in phishing and spam attacks to help boost the open rate and efficacy of malicious emails.
In many email attacks, embedded links lead to phishing sites designed to swipe sensitive information or login credentials from recipients.
Others contain malware-laden attachments, or employ social engineering to bamboozle well-researched targets out of money in spear-phishing or business email compromise (BEC) scams.
In order to spoof an email, all a fraudster needs to do is set up or compromise an SMTP server.
From there, they can manipulate the 'From', 'Reply-To', and 'Return-Path' email addresses to make their phishing emails appear to be legitimate messages from the individual or brand they're impersonating.
